Project I worked on for my R course. It is to help create better bullpen usage and assign archetypes to different relief pitchers for roles they would best be suited for. I plan on changing the code out of STAN and adding more archetypes in the future. Each role was done through Bayesian methodology and results are in the PowerPoint.
